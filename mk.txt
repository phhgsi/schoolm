module permissions :- Create a role-based permission system for a school management system with four roles: Admin, Teacher, Cashier, and Student. Admin has full access to all modules including user management, students, teachers, classes, attendance, exams, fees, events, gallery, reports, and settings. Teachers can manage attendance, marks, and classes only for their assigned subjects. Cashiers can only manage fees, payments, receipts, and financial reports.

(admin module)
Dashboard Page :-The Dashboard serves as the central hub of the Admin Panel, providing a quick overview of the entire school’s activities. It displays key statistics such as the total number of students, teachers, and classes, along with financial summaries of collected and pending fees. Graphs and charts showcase student attendance percentages, fee collection trends, and exam performance summaries. Notifications highlight important alerts like upcoming events, pending fee payments, and exam schedules. Quick action buttons allow the admin to immediately add new students, teachers, or events without navigating to other modules.
Students Page :-The Students page allows full management of student records within the system. It provides a searchable and filterable table view where admins can easily locate students by class, section, or name. From here, the admin can add new students using an admission form, edit existing student details, or delete records if necessary. Each student has an individual profile page displaying personal details, guardian information, assigned class, fee status, attendance history, and academic results. The page also supports data import/export in Excel or CSV format for bulk management, along with an option to generate student ID cards.
Teachers Page :-The Teachers page is dedicated to managing teacher profiles and academic responsibilities. Admins can add new teachers by entering their qualifications, subject specializations, and contact details. Teachers can be assigned to classes and subjects, ensuring accurate workload distribution. Each teacher has a profile page containing their attendance, assigned classes, timetable, and performance metrics. The admin can edit or delete records as needed, and search tools make it easy to filter teachers by subject or department.
Classes & Subjects Page:- The Classes & Subjects page enables the admin to organize academic structures. Admins can create new classes and sections, assign subjects to them, and link teachers to specific subjects. This ensures that each class has a complete academic framework with students and teachers properly connected. The page also allows viewing all students assigned to a particular class and optionally supports timetable management, giving a structured overview of daily schedules.
Attendance Page:-The Attendance page provides tools for recording and managing both student and teacher attendance. Admins can select a class or teacher and mark daily attendance using checkboxes for Present, Absent, or Late. Attendance data can also be uploaded in bulk using CSV or Excel files. The system generates detailed reports that can be viewed by class, student, or teacher over a specified time period. Graphical summaries allow quick insights into attendance trends and performance.
Exams & Results Page:- The Exams & Results page allows the admin to create exams, assign subjects, and manage student marks. Exams can be categorized as mid-term, final, or custom, with dates and maximum marks defined for each subject.

Admins can generate class-wise or student-wise results, download printable report cards in PDF format, and publish results to the student portal for viewing.
Fees Page:-The Fees page manages the school’s financial transactions. Admins can define fee structures based on class, term, or special services like transport and hostel. Payments can be recorded with details such as date, amount, mode (cash, cheque, online), and receipt number. The page tracks pending fees and provides options for generating and printing receipts. Comprehensive financial reports summarize collections on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, giving the admin a clear picture of school revenue.
Events & Announcements Page:-The Events & Announcements page allows admins to post upcoming events like annual day, sports day, or cultural functions, as well as important notices such as admission deadlines or exam schedules. Each event includes a title, description, date, venue, and optional image. Events can be published directly to the homepage carousel or scheduled in advance. An integrated calendar view provides a timeline of all upcoming and past events for easy reference.
Gallery Page:-The Gallery page manages all media content related to school functions and activities. Admins can upload images and videos, organize them into categories such as Sports, Cultural, or Academics, and publish them to the public gallery. The page supports bulk uploads and allows hiding or deleting media files as needed. This feature keeps the school website visually engaging and regularly updated with fresh content.
Reports Page:-The Reports page centralizes all analytical data in the system. Admins can generate attendance reports, exam performance summaries, financial fee reports, and teacher workload statistics. Reports can be customized by date range, class, or department and exported in PDF or Excel format for official use. This page ensures the school can analyze trends, identify issues, and present data for audits or parent meetings.
Settings Page:-The Settings page controls the core configuration of the school management system. Admins can update school details such as name, logo, motto, contact information, and address. User management tools allow creating, editing, or deleting accounts for Admins, Teachers, Cashiers, and Students, with role-based permissions determining access levels. The page also includes homepage content management (carousel, about section, courses, testimonials, footer), API and security settings, and options for database backup and restore.
