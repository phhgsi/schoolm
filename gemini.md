# Project Gemini: School Management System

This document outlines the features, architecture, and workflow for a comprehensive School Management System.

## 1. Project Overview

The School Management System is a complete web-based application designed to automate and manage the academic and administrative activities of a school. It provides a centralized platform for various users, including administrators, teachers, cashiers, and students, each with a dedicated portal tailored to their roles. The system will feature a dynamic public-facing website and a powerful admin panel for management, all powered by a robust backend.

## 2. Technology Stack

The system will be built using a hybrid setup to ensure flexibility, performance, and scalability.
* **[span_0](start_span)Backend:** PHP + MySQL[span_0](end_span)
* **[span_1](start_span)Frontend:** Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap (for styling flexibility)[span_1](end_span)
* **[span_2](start_span)JavaScript:** jQuery + Vanilla JS[span_2](end_span)
* **Data Handling:** AJAX and a RESTful API will be used for seamless data handling without page reloads. [span_3](start_span)[span_4](start_span)[span_5](start_span)This approach ensures that both the web application and potential future mobile apps can consume the same API responses.[span_3](end_span)[span_4](end_span)[span_5](end_span)

## 3. System Architecture & Flowcharts

### 3.1. General Data Flow (AJAX/API)

This flow is central to the application's dynamic nature, from the homepage to the admin panel.

    A[User Action e.g., Click Button] --> B{JavaScript/jQuery Event Listener};
    B --> C[AJAX Request to PHP API Endpoint];
    C --> D{PHP Script Processes Request};
    D --> E[Interacts with MySQL Database];
    E --> D;
    D --> F[Returns Data as JSON Response];
    F --> C;
    C --> G[AJAX Success Callback];
    G --> H[JavaScript/jQuery Updates HTML DOM];
    H --> I[UI is Updated without Page Reload];

3.2. User Authentication & Role-Based Redirection Flow

    A[User Visits Login Page] --> B(Enters Username/Password);
    B --> C{Submits Form};
    C --> D[AJAX POST Request to Auth API];
    D --> E{PHP Backend};
    E --> F[Verify Credentials against Hashed Password in MySQL];
    subgraph Verification
        F -- Valid --> G[Identify User Role: Admin, Teacher, etc.];
        F -- Invalid --> H[Return Error Message];
    end
    G --> I[Return Success + Role + Token];
    H --> D;
    I --> D;
    D -- Success --> J[JS Redirects to Role-Specific Dashboard, e.g., /admin/dashboard];
    D -- Error --> K[JS Displays Error Message on Login Page];

3.3. Database & File Management
Database: MySQL will be the primary database. [cite_start]Database creation and schema management should be possible via the terminal for real-time setup and also maintained in a .sql file for version control and deployment. [cite: 165]
File Storage: All uploaded files (like student photos, gallery images) will be stored on the web hosting server. The database will only store the file link/path. [cite_start]To avoid conflicts and ensure data integrity, files will be renamed upon upload. [cite: 165]
4. Core Features & Modules
4.1. Academic Year Management
[cite_start]All data within the system will be organized and stored according to the academic year. [cite: 1]
[cite_start]When an academic year is deleted, its associated data will be archived in the database for record-keeping. [cite: 1]
[cite_start]An option for permanent deletion of archived data will be available if necessary. [cite: 1]
4.2. Public-Facing Website
[cite_start]A dynamic homepage will serve as the public face of the school. [cite: 2]
[cite_start]Sections: The homepage will include a Header, Image Carousel, About section, Courses, Events, Achievements, Gallery, Testimonials, a Call-to-Action (CTA), and a Footer. [cite: 3]
[cite_start]Content Management: All content displayed on the homepage must be fully manageable from the Admin Panel. [cite: 4, 5]
[cite_start]Dynamic Loading: Data will be loaded dynamically using PHP APIs and AJAX to ensure the site is fast and up-to-date. [cite: 6, 24]
4.3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
[cite_start]The system is built around four primary user roles, with permissions managed in the MySQL database and editable from the Admin Panel. [cite: 17, 20]
[cite_start]Admin: Has full access to all modules, including user management, settings, and all academic and financial data. [cite: 17]
[cite_start]Teacher: Can manage attendance and marks only for their assigned classes and subjects. [cite: 17]
[cite_start]Cashier: Access is restricted to managing fees, payments, receipts, and financial reports. [cite: 18, 143]
[cite_start]Student: Has read-only access to their personal information, including attendance, results, fee status, and school announcements. [cite: 19]
